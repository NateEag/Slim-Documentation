A Slim application provides a log object that writes data to a specific output. The actual writing of data is
delegated to a log writer.

## How to log data

To log data in a Slim application, get a reference to the log object:

    <?php
    $log = $app->getLog();

The log object provides the following interface:

    $log->debug(mixed $object);
    $log->info(mixed $object);
    $log->warn(mixed $object);
    $log->error(mixed $object);
    $log->fatal(mixed $object);

Each log object method accepts one mixed argument. The argument is usually a string, but the argument can be
anything. The log object will pass the argument to its log writer. It is the log writerâ€™s responsibility to write
arbitrary input to the appropriate destination.
