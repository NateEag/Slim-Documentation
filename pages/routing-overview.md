The Slim Framework helps you map resource URIs to callback functions for specific HTTP request methods
(e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS or HEAD). A Slim application will invoke the first route that matches the
current HTTP requestâ€™s URI and method.

If the Slim application does not find routes with URIs that match the HTTP request URI, it will automatically return
a **404 Not Found** response.

If the Slim application finds routes with URIs that match the HTTP request URI *but not* the HTTP request method,
it will automatically return a **405 Method Not Allowed** response with an `Allow:` header whose value lists
HTTP methods that are acceptable for the requested resource.
